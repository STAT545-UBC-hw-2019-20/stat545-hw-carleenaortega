## Introduction
My name is Carleena Ortega :woman:. I moved from Toronto :snowman: to Vancouver :sunny: to pursue my Masters in Experimental Medicine at UBC. 
My interests include:
* *Gardening* :herb: :hibiscus:
* *Animals* :dog: :koala: 
* *Swimming* :swimmer:
* *Nature* :ocean: :deciduous_tree:

I have no previous experience with R but I'm interested in learning its diverse applications and hopefully use it for my research and daily life! :100:
