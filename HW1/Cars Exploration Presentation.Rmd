## **Introduction**

*Welcome to this presentation!*

We will be exploring the **cars** data in this presentation

## **Table of Contents**

- Summary of Cars
- Car Distance with respect to Speed

## **Summary of Cars**
Here we show the cars data using the summary function. We see the the mean speed is 15.4 and the mean distance 42.98.
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## **Car Distance with respect to Speed**
We observe that there is a positive relationship between the variables as distance increases with speed.
```{r, fig.width=6,fig.height=4}
plot(cars$speed,cars$dist,xlab ="Speed",ylab="Distance")
```
