# Exercise 1: Explain the value of the here::here package

In your own words, summarize the value of the here::here package in 250 words or fewer.

The here::here package is similar to the base R function file.path() since it allows the user to write files safely along paths. One of the advantages of the here::here package over is that it can be recognized by different platforms(Windows, Apple, etc.). Another advantage of the here::here package is the ability to save files along a pathway without explicitly stating the pathway, which saves time and is less frustrating. It can also load files and save them in a different pathway (if desired) without the hassle of figuring out and stating the entire pathways. It is also allows the reproducibility of files as it allows other people to run your code. Lastly, it allows opening .R files when using a new session.


# Exercise 2: Factor management

We choose the `gapminder` dataset and select `continent` as the factor to explore. The code below determines whether gapminder's continent is a factor or not; how many levels it has and what these levels are. In addition, we also use the str() command to show a summary of the dataset, including how many observations (rows) we have.
```{r}
class(gapminder$continent)
nlevels(gapminder$continent)
levels(gapminder$continent)
str(gapminder)
```
We now know that `continent` is a factor with 5 levels named Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. We also have 1704 rows or observations as shown by the str() function.

Our next step is to filter and drop levels. We filter out Oceania and then drop the unused factor levels in continent. 

```{r}
drop_Ocn<-gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent !="Oceania") %>% 
  droplevels()

drop_Ocn$continent %>% 
  nlevels() 

drop_Ocn$continent %>% 
  levels()

str(drop_Ocn)
```

We have successfully filtered out the data from Oceania as we now have only 4 levels in continent named Africa, Americas, Asia, and Europe. The str() function also shows that we have 1680 observations, which is less than the original dataset (1704 observations).

Our next goal is to explore the effects of re-leveling a factor with the modified gapminder data set. For this, we will use the summarized max gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of each continent.

```{r}
drop_Ocn %>% 
  select(continent,gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(maxGDP=max(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  arrange(maxGDP) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= continent, y =maxGDP))+
  geom_bar(stat='identity', colour="light blue", fill="light blue")+
  labs(x="Continent",y="Max GDP ($)",title="The Max GDP of Continents (Original)")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma)+
  theme_bw()
```

The arrange() command applies just to the tibble and did not affect the plot so the continents are arranged in the default alphabetic order. We can modify the above graph and re-order the continents using the forcats package as shown below.


```{r}
drop_Ocn %>% 
  select(continent,gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(maxGDP=max(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= fct_reorder(continent,maxGDP), y =maxGDP)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity',colour="royal blue",fill="royal blue")+
  labs(x="Continent",y="Max GDP ($)",title="The Max GDP of Continents (Reordered)")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma)+
  theme_bw()
```

This is a more intuitive way of presenting the max GDP of each continent compared to the first plot. It shows the plots in an ascending order that makes it easy to see that Africa has the lowest GDP and Asia has the highest GDP. It also makes it easier to compare between continents.

# Exercise 3: File input/output (I/O)

For this exercise, we will modify the `gapminder` data set to filter for data from Africa in 2007. We will then export this file using write_csv().

```{r}
gapminder_africa2007 <-gapminder %>% 
  filter(year==2007,continent=="Africa")

  write_csv(gapminder_africa2007,here::here("HW05","gapminder_africa2007.csv"))
```


We will now reload the exported file back into R using read_csv() and play around its factor levels.

```{r}
read_csv(here::here("HW05","gm_africa2007.csv")) %>% 
  arrange(lifeExp) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x=lifeExp,y=country))+
  labs(x="Country",y="Life Expectancy (years)",title="The Life Expectancy of African Countries in 2007")+
  theme_bw(base_size=9.5)
```

The original plot is arranged alphabetically by default. This is preferred for some tasks but for our purpose, we will rearrange the countries in an ascending order according to their life expectancies using fct_order().

```{r African 2007 LE plot}
read_csv(here::here("HW05","gapminder_africa2007.csv")) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x=lifeExp,y=fct_reorder(country,lifeExp)))+
  labs(x="Country",y="Life Expectancy (years)",title="The Life Expectancy of African countries in 2007")+
  theme_bw(base_size=9.5)+
  ggsave("African 2007 LE.png",height=6,width=5)
```

The life expectancy of Africans in 2007 ranges from around 40 to 79 with Swaziland having the lowest life expectancy and Reunion with the highest life expectancy.

We have successfully exported, imported, and modified the gapminder_africa2007 file. Therefore, I can say that it has successfully passed being written to file and being read back in.

# Exercise 4: Visualization design

I have chosen to revise the plot I made for HW02 Exercise 3.2. The code and plot are as follows:
```{r warning=FALSE}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country=="Canada") %>%
  ggplot(aes(lifeExp, pop)) +
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(x="Life Expectancy", y="Population", title="The Life Expectancy of 
    Canadians with respect to Population") +
  theme_light()
```

I noticed that the data points are not shown, the axes do not start at zero, and the line has both blue and grey colours which are not explained in a legend, and that geom_smooth is not the best function to plot the data.

I will further improve the plot by applying the principles I have learned about effective plotting. The plot is as follows:
```{r warning=FALSE}
Can_LEpop<-gapminder %>%
  filter(country=="Canada")

Can_LEpop %>% 
  ggplot(aes(lifeExp, pop)) +
  geom_point(size=3)+
  geom_line(color="black")+
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(72,78),breaks=seq(72,78, by=2))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma,limits=c(20500000,29000000),breaks=seq(20500000,29000000, by=1000000))+
  labs(x="Life Expectancy", y="Population", title="The Life Expectancy of 
    Canadians with respect to Population") +
  theme_light()
```

The improved graph includes the data points, shows axes lines that make it easier to determine the point's location, and also shows the y-axis numbers in a readable format as opposed to the scientific notation in the older plot version. I left the axes ranges as is since although we learned in the lecture that the plots should usually start at zero because the values are really high so starting from zero would squeeze the data points together and will also leave a lot of blank space, which I think would make it harder for the observer to understand the plot.

# Exercise 5: Writing figures to file 

For this exercise, I saved the second plot in Exercise 3 called "African 2007 LE". We can load and embed it to this report as follows:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# ![plot](/Users/carleenaortega/Documents/STAT 545A/HW/stat545-hw-carleenaortega/HW05/African 2007 LE.png)
```
When using the ggsave() command, we need to explicitly determine plot in ggsave when we want to save a plot other than the last one that was saved.
